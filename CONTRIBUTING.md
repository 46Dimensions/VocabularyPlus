## Creating Issues
Have you found a reproducible problem in Vocabulary Plus or have a request for a feature? Use an issue to tell us.
You can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/46Dimensions/VocabularyPlus/issues/new). Below are guidelines on how to do this effectively.
### Check if the issue already exists
Before creating an issue, please search in [Open Issues](https://github.com/46Dimensions/VocabularyPlus/issues/) to see if a similar issue or feature requests exists already.
If you find that the issue/feature request already exists, make relevant comments and reactions.
Instead of a "+1" or "-1" comment to vote for a feature request, use a reaction.
* 👍 - up vote (+1)
* 👎 - down vote (-1)
If you cannot find a similar issue/feature request, create a new issue with the guidelines below.
### Creating a good issue
Create a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.   
Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue.   
The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.   
A good issue should include:
* Your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux)
* Python version
* Vocabulary Plus version (use `vocabularyplus --version`)
* A list of steps (1... 2... 3... etc) to reproduce the issue
* What you saw, versus what you expected to see
* An image or link to a video showing the issue occurring
